# Project name: LDP final project
**Date created: 2025-09-08**
**Last updated: 2025-09-29**

This is the README file for my final project for the Living Data Project's Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology course. This project seeks to create an example of a fully reproducible research project. To complete this project, I am using the Palmer Penguins dataset, an open-access dataset that includes physical measurements of adult penguins observed on the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## File structure
**00_rawdata:** includes all raw data used for this project, a README file, and a data dictionary
**01_scripts:** includes my script for reading in and processing data, as well as my data analysis script
**02_outdata:** includes processed data, a README file, and a data dictionary
**03_figures:** includes all figures
**04_manuscript:** includes the RMD script to produce the final manuscript

## Naming conventions
The files are named as follows:
CG_LDP_description_version,
where CG is an acronym for my name (Cindy Gao), LDP is an acronym for the Living Data Project, and description is a sensible description of the file. For raw data files, version will be a number starting from 1 indicating the iteration of the data, with 1 being the earliest version of the data and the largest number being the latest.

For example, my data could be named: CG_LDP_PenguinTraits1
