Plant functional traits have been shown to be adapted to climate and have evolved patterns of trait correlations (similar patterns of distribution) and coordinations (mechanistic trade-off). We predicted that traits would differentiate between populations associated with climatic gradients, suggestive of adaptive variation, and correlated traits would adapt to future climate scenarios in similar ways.We measured genetically determined trait variation and described patterns of correlation for seven traits: photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf size (LS), specific leaf area (SLA), {$\delta$}13C (integrated water-use efficiency, WUE), nitrogen concentration (NCONC), and wood density (WD). All measures were conducted in an experimental plantation on 960 trees sourced from 12 populations of a key forest canopy species in southwestern Australia.Significant differences were found between populations for all traits. Narrow-sense heritability was significant for five traits (0.15--0.21), indicating that natural selection can drive differentiation; however, SLA (0.08) and PRI (0.11) were not significantly heritable. Generalized additive models predicted trait values across the landscape for current and future climatic conditions ({$>$}90\% variance). The percent change differed markedly among traits between current and future predictions (differing as little as 1.5\% ({$\delta$}13C) or as much as 30\% (PRI)). Some trait correlations were predicted to break down in the future (SLA:NCONC, {$\delta$}13C:PRI, and NCONC:WD).Synthesis: Our results suggest that traits have contrasting genotypic patterns and will be subjected to different climate selection pressures, which may lower the working optimum for functional traits. Further, traits are independently associated with different climate factors, indicating that some trait correlations may be disrupted in the future. Genetic constraints and trait correlations may limit the ability for functional traits to adapt to climate change. , We tested whether functional traits of an important tree species in southwestern Australia were genetically determined and able to undergo selection. Our results suggest that some traits are heritable (Water Use Efficiency) while others are not (SLA), indicating that in the future, under different climates, selection will differentially effect traits. Therefore, it is likely that current trait combinations will change with climate.},

Whether such phenomena occur in nonmarine systems and if secondary foundation species enhance food web structure (e.g., support novel feeding guilds) and ecosystem function (e.g., provide nursery for juveniles) remain unclear. Here we report on field experiments designed to test whether trees improve epiphyte survival and epiphytes secondarily increase the number and diversity of adult and juvenile invertebrates in a potential live oak-Tillandsia usneoides (Spanish moss) facilitation cascade. Our results reveal that trees reduce physical stress to facilitate Tillandsia, which, in turn, reduces desiccation and predation stress to facilitate invertebrates. In experimental removals, invertebrate total density, juvenile density, species richness and H' diversity were 16, 60, 1.7, and 1.5 times higher, and feeding guild richness and H' were 5 and 11 times greater in Tillandsia-colonized relative to Tillandsia-removal limb plots. Tillandsia enhanced communities similarly in a survey across the southeastern United States. These findings reveal that a facilitation cascade organizes this widespread terrestrial assemblage and expand the role of secondary foundation species as drivers of trophic structure and ecosystem function. We conceptualize the relationship between foundation species' structural attributes and associated species abundance and composition in a Foundation Species-Biodiversity (FSB) model. Importantly, the FSB predicts that, where secondary foundation species form expansive and functionally distinct structures that increase habitat availability and complexity within primary foundation species, they generate and maintain hot spots of biodiversity and trophic interactions.},

We reviewed and scored 400 modeling studies over the past 20 years using the proposed standards and guidelines. We detected low model adequacy overall, but with a marked tendency of improvement over time in model building and, to a lesser degree, in biological data and model evaluation. We argue that implementation of agreed-upon standards for models in biodiversity assessments would promote transparency and repeatability, eventually leading to higher quality of the models and the inferences used in assessments. We encourage broad community participation toward the expansion and ongoing development of the proposed standards and guidelines.}

Contemporary visions of the evolutionary process often focus on one or two of these varieties and ignore the others. A unifying framework that considers all four major varieties of constraint is emerging within the discipline of quantitative genetics. I attempt to sketch that emerging framework and summarize recent efforts toward unification. Although couched in the technical language of quantitative genetics, the ongoing search for a common framework promises a rapprochement among the approaches of optimality theorists, population geneticists, and developmental biologists.}

This well-known ecogeographic pattern has been considered a general trend for all animals, yet support for Bergmann's rule has only been demonstrated for mammals and birds. Here we evaluate Bergmann's rule in two groups of reptiles: chelonians (turtles) and squamates (lizards and snakes). We perform both nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic analyses and show that chelonians follow Bergmann's rule (19 of 23 species increase in size with latitude; 14 of 15 species decrease in size with temperature), whereas squamates follow the converse to Bergmann's rule (61 of 83 species decrease in size with latitude; 40 of 56 species increase in size with temperature).

These trends are consistent among major groups of chelonians and squamates for which data are available. This is the first study to document the converse to Bergmann's rule in any major animal group as well as the first to show Bergmann's rule in a major group of ectotherms. The traditional explanation for Bergmann's rule is that larger endothermic individuals conserve heat better in cooler areas.

We used a whole-community approach to examine how species interactions contribute to the maintenance of a rocky intertidal macroalgal canopy--understorey assemblage. We determined both the types of interactions in this network, and whether interactions were sensitive to environmental gradients. Focusing on a structurally dominant canopy kelp Saccharina sessilis, and its diverse co-occurring understorey assemblage, we evaluated the role of the understorey in controlling S. sessilis recruitment and quantified the reciprocal effect of the S. sessilis canopy and understorey on one another using a removal experiment replicated across 600 km of coastline. We determined the sensitivity of interactions to natural variation in light and nutrient availability (replicated among four regions on the N.E. Pacific coast), and under different wave conditions (three wave regimes). Surprisingly, species interactions were similar across sites and thus not context-dependent. Unexpectedly, the understorey community had a strong positive effect on the S. sessilis canopy, whereby the adult canopy decreased dramatically following understorey removal. Additionally, S. sessilis recruitment depended on the presence of understorey coralline algal turf. In turn, the canopy had a neutral effect on the coralline understorey, but a negative effect on non-calcifying algal turfs, likely eventually generating positive indirect canopy effects on the coralline understorey. Density-dependent intraspecific competition between S. sessilis adults and recruits may moderate this positive feedback between the S. sessilis canopy and coralline understorey. Synthesis. Our research highlights the importance of positive interactions for coexistence in natural communities, and the necessity of studying multiple life-history stages and reciprocal species interactions in order to elucidate the mechanisms that maintain diversity.},

However, in many cases, niche shifts are associated with changes in an underlying continuous trait like body size and we have few predictions concerning conditions for coexistence for such a widespread form of ontogenetic development. We develop a framework for analyzing species coexistence based on Integral Projection Models (IPMs) that incorporates continuous ontogenetic changes in both the resource niche and competitive ability. We parameterize the model using experimental data from Trinidadian guppies and show how niche shifts and competitive symmetries impact species coexistence. Overall, our results show that the effects of competition on fitness depend upon trait-mediated niche-separation, trait-mediated competitive asymmetry in the part of the niche that is shared across body sizes, and the sensitivity of fitness to body size. Interactions among these processes generate multiple routes to coexistence.

Functional redundancy is hypothesized to promote ecological resilience and stability, as ecosystem function of communities with more redundant species (those that perform similar functions) should be buffered against the loss of individual species. While functional redundancy is being increasingly quantified, few studies have linked differences in redundancy across communities to ecological outcomes. We conducted a review and meta-analysis to determine whether empirical evidence supports the asserted link between functional redundancy and ecosystem stability and resilience. We reviewed 423 research articles and assembled a data set of 32 studies from 15 articles across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Overall, the mean correlation between functional redundancy and ecological stability/resilience was positive. The mean positive effect of functional redundancy was greater for studies in which redundancy was measured as species richness within functional groups (vs. metrics independent of species richness), but species richness itself was not correlated with effect size. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that functional redundancy may positively affect community stability and resilience to disturbance, but more empirical work is needed including more experimental studies, partitioning of richness and redundancy effects, and links to ecosystem functions.},

  abstract = {Co-occurring foundation species can determine biological community structure via facilitation cascades. We examined the density dependencies of facilitation cascades, including how the density of a basal foundation species influences the density of secondary foundation species, and how the density of secondary foundation species influences community structure. The system in which we assessed density dependencies was a temperate mangrove forest in which pneumatophores trap the fucoid alga Hormosira banksii and provide substrate for the oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. The alga and oyster in turn determine benthic community structure. In the field, algal biomass was positively correlated with pneumatophore density. Oysters, by contrast, were highly over-dispersed and correlated with the presence/absence of pneumatophores. Epifaunal abundance and species richness were positively correlated with algal and oyster abundance, but their effects were independent. The positive effect of pneumatophore density on epifauna was primarily an indirect effect of trapping more algae. Pneumatophores did not directly influence invertebrate communities. Experiments revealed that, at very low pneumatophore densities, algal retention was insufficient to facilitate epifauna above that found on pneumatophores alone. At higher densities, however, increasing the density of pneumatophores increased algal retention, and the density and diversity of associated invertebrates. Shading by the mangrove canopy reduced algal biomass but did not modify the density-dependent nature of the cascade. Our results extend facilitation theory by showing that the density of both basal and secondary foundation species can be critical in triggering facilitation cascades. Our study also reveals that, where foundation species co-occur, multiple, independent cascades may arise from a single basal facilitator. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of density-dependent facilitation cascades in community assembly.},

  abstract = {The relationship between environmental gradients and patterns of geographic variation in body size has been a controversial topic for ectothermic organisms globally. To examine whether the patterns that generally hold in more temperate species also hold for tropical ones, we examined the intraspecific body size variation in three species of Neotropical frogs, Dendropsophus minutus, Hypsiboas faber and Physalaemus cuvieri, along different environmental gradients (e.g. temperature, precipitation and topography). We analysed four competing hypotheses: (i) the water availability hypothesis that predicts a negative relationship between body size and precipitation; (ii) the heat balance hypothesis that predicts a negative relationship between body size and temperature; (iii) the topography hypothesis that predicts a negative relationship between body size and altitude; and (iv) the mixed-effect hypothesis that predicts that individuals occurring in wet and cold sites would be larger than individuals occurring in dry and warm sites. The spatial pattern of geographic variation in body size among populations of H. faber was associated with the mixed-effect hypothesis. In localities with low precipitation seasonality and cold conditions, H. faber individuals were larger than in localities with high precipitation seasonality and warm conditions. Variation in the body size of D. minutus was the opposite of that predicted by the heat balance hypothesis. Individuals in localities with high temperatures were larger than in localities with low temperatures. On the other hand, variation in the body size of P. cuvieri was not associated with the variables used in this study. Our results suggest that intraspecific variation in anuran body size is more dependent on species-specific response than on the region (i.e. temperate or tropical) where they occur.},

  abstract = {Canopy-forming algae have been shown to play a fundamental role in the maintenance of understorey assemblages on rocky shores. In the Mediterranean, low-shore habitats are often monopolised by canopy algae of the genus Cystoseira and, in particular, by the species Cystoseira amentacea var. stricta. Alternatively, low-shore habitats are dominated by turf-forming algae and/or mussels. Previous studies showed that loss of Cystoseira, by natural or anthropogenic disturbances, resulted in the increase of turfing algae. Here, we propose that turf-forming algae may act as colonisers from nearby habitats, specifically from lower portions of the shore. The following hypotheses were tested to investigate this proposition: (1) in presence of Cystoseira, the assemblage living under its canopy will be distinct, in terms of composition and structure, from that found lower on the shore, (2) if the canopy of Cystoseira was removed, the differences between the two assemblages would decrease or disappear, (3) the effects of the canopy would be more important than other causes of variability at the spatial scale investigated (hundreds to thousands of metres), and (4) that effects of removal of the canopy would be consistent through time. These hypotheses were tested by means of a canopy removal experiment, involving several spatial and temporal repetitions of the manipulation. The assemblage underneath the canopy of Cystoseira was distinct from that found immediately lower on the shore, but when the canopy was removed there were no differences between the two. The effects of the canopy were consistent at the spatial and temporal scales investigated. Several species living under the canopy disappeared and were replaced by turf-forming species, resulting in a homogenisation of the two habitats and in a drastic loss of habitat diversity. This study shows that Cystoseira can be considered a habitat-forming species, responsible for the maintenance of two distinct low-shore assemblages. In this light, its importance should be taken into account by policies aiming to preserve biodiversity on rocky shores.},

  abstract = {Canopy-forming algae have been shown to play a fundamental role in the maintenance of understorey assemblages on rocky shores. In the Mediterranean, low-shore habitats are often monopolised by canopy algae of the genus Cystoseira and, in particular, by the species Cystoseira amentacea var. stricta. Alternatively, low-shore habitats are dominated by turf-forming algae and/or mussels. Previous studies showed that loss of Cystoseira, by natural or anthropogenic disturbances, resulted in the increase of turfing algae. Here, we propose that turf-forming algae may act as colonisers from nearby habitats, specifically from lower portions of the shore. The following hypotheses were tested to investigate this proposition: (1) in presence of Cystoseira, the assemblage living under its canopy will be distinct, in terms of composition and structure, from that found lower on the shore, (2) if the canopy of Cystoseira was removed, the differences between the two assemblages would decrease or disappear, (3) the effects of the canopy would be more important than other causes of variability at the spatial scale investigated (hundreds to thousands of metres), and (4) that effects of removal of the canopy would be consistent through time. These hypotheses were tested by means of a canopy removal experiment, involving several spatial and temporal repetitions of the manipulation. The assemblage underneath the canopy of Cystoseira was distinct from that found immediately lower on the shore, but when the canopy was removed there were no differences between the two. The effects of the canopy were consistent at the spatial and temporal scales investigated. Several species living under the canopy disappeared and were replaced by turf-forming species, resulting in a homogenisation of the two habitats and in a drastic loss of habitat diversity. This study shows that Cystoseira can be considered a habitat-forming species, responsible for the maintenance of two distinct low-shore assemblages. In this light, its importance should be taken into account by policies aiming to preserve biodiversity on rocky shores.},

The development of reliable early warning indicators (EWIs) to predict these changes is vital for the adaptive management of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, natural capital and ecosystem services. Increased variance and autocorrelation are potential early warning indicators and can be readily estimated from ecological time series. Here, we undertook a comprehensive test of the consistency between early warning indicators and nonlinear abundance change across species, trophic levels and ecosystem types. We tested whether long-term abundance time series of 55 taxa (126 data sets) across multiple trophic levels in marine and freshwater ecosystems showed (i) significant nonlinear change in abundance `turning points' and (ii) significant increases in variance and autocorrelation (`early warning indicators'). For each data set, we then quantified the prevalence of three cases: true positives (early warning indicators and associated turning point), false negatives (turning point but no associated early warning indicators) and false positives (early warning indicators but no turning point). True positives were rare, representing only 9\% (16 of 170) of cases using variance, and 13\% (19 of 152) of cases using autocorrelation. False positives were more prevalent than false negatives (53\% vs. 38\% for variance; 47\% vs. 40\% for autocorrelation). False results were found in every decade and across all trophic levels and ecosystems. Time series that contained true positives were uncommon (8\% for variance; 6\% for autocorrelation), with all but one time series also containing false classifications. Coherence between the types of early warning indicators was generally low with 43\% of time series categorized differently based on variance compared to autocorrelation. Synthesis and applications. Conservation management requires effective early warnings of ecosystem change using readily available data, and variance and autocorrelation in abundance data have been suggested as candidates. However, our study shows that they consistently fail to predict nonlinear change. For early warning indicators to be effective tools for preventative management of ecosystem change, we recommend that multivariate approaches of a suite of potential indicators are adopted, incorporating analyses of anthropogenic drivers and process-based understanding.},

  abstract = {Riparian ecosystems in the 21st century are likely to play a critical role in determining the vulnerability of natural and human systems to climate change, and in influencing the capacity of these systems to adapt. Some authors have suggested that riparian ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to their high levels of exposure and sensitivity to climatic stimuli, and their history of degradation. Others have highlighted the probable resilience of riparian ecosystems to climate change as a result of their evolution under high levels of climatic and environmental variability. We synthesize current knowledge of the vulnerability of riparian ecosystems to climate change by assessing the potential exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of their key components and processes, as well as ecosystem functions, goods and services, to projected global climatic changes. We review key pathways for ecological and human adaptation for the maintenance, restoration and enhancement of riparian ecosystem functions, goods and services and present emerging principles for planned adaptation. Our synthesis suggests that, in the absence of adaptation, riparian ecosystems are likely to be highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, given the critical role of riparian ecosystem functions in landscapes, as well as the strong links between riparian ecosystems and human well-being, considerable means, motives and opportunities for strategically planned adaptation to climate change also exist. The need for planned adaptation of and for riparian ecosystems is likely to be strengthened as the importance of many riparian ecosystem functions, goods and services will grow under a changing climate.

  abstract = {Riparian ecosystems in the 21st century are likely to play a critical role in determining the vulnerability of natural and human systems to climate change, and in influencing the capacity of these systems to adapt. Some authors have suggested that riparian ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to their high levels of exposure and sensitivity to climatic stimuli, and their history of degradation. Others have highlighted the probable resilience of riparian ecosystems to climate change as a result of their evolution under high levels of climatic and environmental variability. We synthesize current knowledge of the vulnerability of riparian ecosystems to climate change by assessing the potential exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of their key components and processes, as well as ecosystem functions, goods and services, to projected global climatic changes. We review key pathways for ecological and human adaptation for the maintenance, restoration and enhancement of riparian ecosystem functions, goods and services and present emerging principles for planned adaptation. Our synthesis suggests that, in the absence of adaptation, riparian ecosystems are likely to be highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, given the critical role of riparian ecosystem functions in landscapes, as well as the strong links between riparian ecosystems and human well-being, considerable means, motives and opportunities for strategically planned adaptation to climate change also exist. The need for planned adaptation of and for riparian ecosystems is likely to be strengthened as the importance of many riparian ecosystem functions, goods and services will grow under a changing climate. Consequently, riparian ecosystems are likely to become adaptation `hotspots' as the century unfolds.},

We discuss the implications of failing to communicate effectively in each case. We then suggest a general approach for communicating with non-scientist end users. We detail the specific elements to be communicated using the example of individual-based models, which are widely used in ecology. We demonstrate that despite their complexity, individual-based models have characteristics that can facilitate communication with non-scientists.

Our aim is to facilitate the process of communicating with end users of complex models and encourage more modellers to engage in it by providing a structured approach to the communication process.

In this study, we sampled 11 alpine plant communities along the southern Andes in South America, spanning from tropical (25{$^\circ$}S) to sub-antarctic latitudes (55{$^\circ$}S).

Samples taken within cushions always contained more species than equivalent samples from open areas. However, the magnitude of this difference varied among communities. NMDS ordination indicated that cushions generate species assemblages structurally different from those found in open areas. Inclusion of samples from cushion and open areas in synthetic analyses -- where differences in cover were accounted for -- indicated that the presence of cushions consistently increased species richness at the entire community level. The magnitude of these increases in species richness varied with habitat severity, with lower values at both extremes of the environmental severity gradient. 4. Synthesis.

Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

Recent studies indicated that the summer migration of the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) in eastern China is related to the strength and position of the Western Pacific Subtropical High-Pressure (WPSH) system and its associated wind and rainfall patterns. Compared with the BPH, the white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera) has a similar diet, analogous body size, and strong long-distance migration ability.

Based on almost three decades of data (1977--2003), it was suggested that the WBPH in southern China (south of approximately 27{$^\circ$} N) migrates into the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River after the abrupt movements of the WPSH in mid-June, similar to the BPH. By contrast, the emigration of the WBPH in southern China begins in late May. Further analysis indicated that the migration of the WBPH in late May and early June was short or unsuccessful due to heavy precipitation during the preflood season in southern China from late May to middle June.

Although panthers have extensive home ranges and use diverse land covers, methods that dominate panther habitat evaluation for Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultations and regional land use planning consider only forested day-use elements within the landscape mosaic. Maehr and Deason (2002) present a Panther Habitat Evaluation Model (PHEM) that, in addition to excluding nonforested habitat, reduces the assessed value of forest patches based on criteria for patch size, forest type, proximity to a ``core'' area, and connectivity to other patches. An examination of the foundations of PHEM is therefore warranted. Building on earlier work that included an evaluation of panther habitat selection studies (Comiskey et al. 2002), we examine PHEM in light of data quality criteria and the panther's known life history requirements. We conclude that the precepts and rules of the PHEM methodology are based on unwarranted assumptions, nonstandard methods of analysis, and exclusion of relevant data, leading to an undue emphasis on day-use land cover and forest patches larger than 500 ha. Large areas of southern Florida that have abundant prey and are intensively used by panthers would score low in PHEM habitat assessments because they lack large forest patches. We discuss the conservation implications of applying a methodology that discounts substantial portions of occupied panther habitat as unsuitable, and describe an alternative approach to habitat definition and evaluation that is both consistent with panther habitat requirements and applicable to conservation decision-making. Conserving sufficient habitat for recovery of the panther extends an umbrella of protection to the many species that dwell within its range.},

Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in their research.

However, ecologists tend to be less focused on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more traditional modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There are also multiple ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Bayesian P values are relatively easy to compute, but are well known to be conservative, producing P values biased toward 0.5. Alternatively, lesser known approaches to model checking, such as prior predictive checks, cross-validation probability integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may produce more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and targeted diagnostics can be used to examine violations of different model assumptions and lack of fit at different levels of the modeling hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or spatial autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing literature to guide ecologists through the many available options for Bayesian model checking. We illustrate methods and procedures with several ecological case studies including (1) analysis of simulated spatiotemporal count data, (2) N-mixture models for estimating abundance of sea otters from an aircraft, and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance patterns of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values detect extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more subtle cases of lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and pivot discrepancy measures (including the ``sampled predictive P value'') appear to be better suited to model checking and to have better overall statistical performance.

Here, we review existing literature and present new empirical data to better characterize the high-altitude environment, and then consider how this environment affects the physiology and evolution of insects. Using weather balloon data from fifty-three sites across the globe, we estimate a mean altitudinal temperature lapse rate of 6.0 {$^\circ$}C/km. We also present empirically determined lapse rates for Po2 and air density. The temperature decline with elevation may substantially compromise insect thermoregulation at high altitude. However, heat-transfer models predict that lower air density at elevation reduces convective heat loss of insects by to a surprisingly large degree. This effect combined with behavioral thermoregulation and the availability of buffered microhabitats make the net thermal consequences of high-altitude residence strongly context-specific. The decline in Po2 with elevation may compromise insect development and physiology, but its effects are difficult to predict without simultaneously considering temperature and air density. Flying insects compensate for low air densities with both short-term responses, such as increased stroke amplitude (but not wingbeat frequency), and with long-term developmental and/or evolutionary increases in wing size relative to body size. Finally, in contrast to predictions based on Bergmann's Rule, a literature survey of thirty-six insect species suggests that those living in colder, higher altitudes do not tend to have larger body sizes.},

Examples include, but are not limited to, flexible Bayesian approaches (e.g. BUGS, stan), frequentist and likelihood-based approaches (e.g. packages lme4) and machine learning methods. These software and programs afford the user greater control and flexibility in tailoring complex hierarchical models. However, this level of control and flexibility places a higher degree of responsibility on the user to evaluate the robustness of their statistical inference. To determine how often biologists are running model diagnostics on hierarchical models, we reviewed 50 recently published papers in 2021 in the journal Nature Ecology \& Evolution, and we found that the majority of published papers did not report any validation of their hierarchical models, making it difficult for the reader to assess the robustness of their inference. This lack of reporting likely stems from a lack of standardized guidance for best practices and standard methods. Here, we provide a guide to understanding and validating complex models using data simulations. To determine how often biologists use data simulation techniques, we also reviewed 50 recently published papers in 2021 in the journal Methods Ecology \& Evolution. We found that 78\% of the papers that proposed a new estimation technique, package or model used simulations or generated data in some capacity (18 of 23 papers); but very few of those papers (5 of 23 papers) included either a demonstration that the code could recover realistic estimates for a dataset with known parameters or a demonstration of the statistical properties of the approach. To distil the variety of simulations techniques and their uses, we provide a taxonomy of simulation studies based on the intended inference. We also encourage authors to include a basic validation study whenever novel statistical models are used, which in general, is easy to implement. Simulating data helps a researcher gain a deeper understanding of the models and their assumptions and establish the reliability of their estimation approaches.

Course Requirements Ph.D. students who joined the program prior to Fall 2021 are required to earn 6 credits from complementary courses. Students joining the program in Fall 2021 or later are required to earn 9 credits: 3 credits from the newly offered introductory graduate research/skills courses BIOL601 \& BIOL602 or BIOL601 \& BIOL603, which they are strongly recommended to take during their first year, and 6 credits from complementary courses (see below).  [course medium BIOL 601] [course medium BIOL 602] [course medium BIOL 603]  [course medium BIOL 700]  Students register for BIOL 700 in the semester when their Qualifying Examination will be taken.  [course medium BIOL 702]  Students register for BIOL 702 in the semester when their Ph.D. Seminar (see below) will be presented. Complementary courses  Must be at the 500-level or above. Course selections must be approved by the Thesis Supervisor. Courses may be selected from the Biology Department, other departments or other universities in Quebec (taken through CREPUQ). Students must attain a passing grade of B- in all required courses. Requests to take supplemental exams should be directed to the Graduate Training Committee. Students may take additional courses not required for their degree (e.g. writing, language and teaching courses), as long as a minimum average of B- is maintained. Graduate-level courses offered by the Department of Biology are listed here.  Seminars \& Presentations Ph.D. students are expected to regularly attend at least one of the department's weekly seminar series. A list of these is available on the Seminars \& Events page. In addition, Ph.D. students are are expected to give at least one research seminar a year to a scientific audience outside of their lab. Presentations should be at least 15 minutes long. First year students are exempt from this requirement.  Qualifying Examination The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination is a formal evaluation of the candidate's ability to proceed to the attainment of the Ph.D. degree and consists of a written proposal, an oral presentation and an oral examination. The Qualifying Examination is not a ``comprehensive'' examination, insofar as this term implies that all areas of biology will be covered. Rather, the intent is to assess the candidate's background knowledge in the field of their proposed research and in relevant areas connected to this subject. Information about each component of the Qualifying Examination and the method of evaluation is available in the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination Report.  Ph.D. Seminar Ph.D. candidates are required to present a seminar on their research toward the end of their studies (preferably at least 3 months prior to the expected date of initial thesis submission). Most students will be registered for this seminar in their third or fourth year. This seminar is not to be regarded as an exam; rather it is intended to give students an opportunity to present their thesis work prior to writing their thesis and holding their Oral Defense. Nevertheless, it is a degree requirement and a grade of "incomplete" will be recorded on the student's transcript for BIOL 702 if they do not give their seminar during the term in which they are registered for this course. In order to receive a grade for BIOL 702, the student's supervisor must submit the PhD seminar form after the seminar.

  abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01\% of the World's water and approximately 0.8\% of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6\% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

Within each category, the most used metrics were the richness and dominance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), Biological Monitoring Working Party scoring systems (BMWP/ASPT), Shannon-Wiener diversity and feeding traits.

This discrepancy between the conceptual foundation of many predictive models and observed community dynamics casts doubts on our ability to successfully predict future community states. Here we used community response diagrams (CRDs) to empirically investigate the occurrence of different classes of disequilibrium responses in plant communities during the Late Quaternary, and bird communities during modern climate warming in North America. We documented a large variability in types of responses including alternate states, suggesting that equilibrium dynamics are not the most common type of response to climate change. Bird responses appeared less predictable to modern climate warming than plant responses to Late Quaternary climate warming. Furthermore, we showed that baseline climate gradients were a strong predictor of disequilibrium states, while ecological factors such as species' traits had a substantial, but inconsistent effect on the deviation from equilibrium. We conclude that (1) complex temporal community dynamics including stochastic responses, lags, and alternate states are common; (2) assuming equilibrium dynamics to predict biodiversity responses to future climate changes may lead to unsuccessful predictions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Furthermore, we showed that baseline climate gradients were a strong predictor of disequilibrium states, while ecological factors such as species' traits had a substantial, but inconsistent effect on the deviation from equilibrium. We conclude that (1) complex temporal community dynamics including stochastic responses, lags, and alternate states are common; (2) assuming equilibrium dynamics to predict biodiversity responses to future climate changes may lead to unsuccessful predictions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Common reforestation techniques treat these shrubs as competitors against newly planted tree seedlings; thus shrubs are cleared before tree plantation. However, empirical studies and theory governing plant-- plant interactions suggest that, in stress-prone Mediterranean environments, shrubs can have a net positive effect on recruitment of other species. Between 1997 and 2001, we carried out experimental reforestations in the Sierra Nevada Protected Area (southeast Spain) with the aim of comparing the survival and growth of seedlings planted in open areas (the current reforestation technique) with seedlings planted under the canopy of preexisting shrub species. Over 18 000 seedlings of 11 woody species were planted under 16 different nurse shrubs throughout a broad geographical area. We sought to explore variation in the sign and magnitude of interactions along spatial gradients defined by altitude and aspect. In the present work, we report the results of a meta-analysis conducted with seedling survival and growth data for the first summer following planting, the most critical period for reforestation success in Mediterranean areas. The facilitative effect was consistent in all environmental situations explored (grand mean effect size d+ = 0.89 for survival and 0.27 for growth). However, there were differences in the magnitude of the interaction, depending on the seedling species planted as well as the nurse shrub species involved. Additionally, nurse shrubs had a stronger facilitative effect on seedling survival and growth at low altitudes and sunny, drier slopes than at high altitudes or shady, wetter slopes. Facilitation in the dry years proved higher than in the one wet year. Our results show that pioneer shrubs facilitate the establishment of woody, late-successional Mediterranean species and thus can positively affect reforestation success in many different ecological settings.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 1201--1210 Abstract Although positive species interactions are ubiquitous in nature, theory has generally focused on the role of negative interactions to explain patterns of species diversity.

They appear to be most common in environments with relatively high physical disturbance, stress, or predation, where associated species can increase the growth and survival of other species unable to survive in isolation. Although ecologists have documented direct positive interactions among species for decades, there is less known about how these interactions affect community species diversity patterns. In this paper, we present a qualitative theoretical model that considers how direct positive interactions affect community species diversity. The model uses, as its basis, familiar unimodel species diversity models (i.e., "compensatory mortality" and "intermediate disturbance" hypothesis) to understand where direct positive interactions are likely to be important. Initially, it predicts that direct positive interactions increase species diversity by facilitating species that might not normally survive under very high physical disturbance, stress, or predation. In addition, it suggests that, under intermediate physical disturbance, stress, or predation, facilitator species that might normally be competitively excluded are released from competition. We suggest that facilitator species may then create new interaction webs that would not be possible in their absence. To illustrate these ideas, we describe a case study taken from a New England salt marsh community where a gradient in physical conditions occurs. In this community, direct positive interactions, and their indirect effects, are predicted to increase the species diversity by at least 35\%. This empirical case study and model show that by incorporating direct positive interactions into ecological experiments and theory, it is possible to expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for community species diversity patterns.},

This has limited understanding of the role of facilitation on ecological dynamics and the integration of facilitation into general theory. I show that facilitative interactions can be classified into four categories likely to be dynamically similar to interaction types for which population-dynamic theory does exist. This classification provides a useful population-dynamic foundation for facilitation studies and reveals several fundamental questions unanswered by existing empirical work. While facilitation has typically been excluded from studies of `competitive' coexistence, I also describe how coexistence theory does not always default to the assumption that species only compete; recent developments in coexistence theory fully accommodate the potentially important influence of facilitation. Simple models of multispecies population dynamics emphasize the importance of reciprocal interspecific interactions, intraspecific interactions, and density dependence for understanding the outcome of facilitative interactions. I point to approaches for aligning future empirical studies of facilitation with these features. Synthesis: Closely aligning at least some future empirical work on facilitation with existing mathematical population dynamic theory will further improve understanding of the effects of facilitation on ecological dynamics.},

While facilitation has typically been excluded from studies of `competitive' coexistence, I also describe how coexistence theory does not always default to the assumption that species only compete; recent developments in coexistence theory fully accommodate the potentially important influence of facilitation. Simple models of multispecies population dynamics emphasize the importance of reciprocal interspecific interactions, intraspecific interactions, and density dependence for understanding the outcome of facilitative interactions. I point to approaches for aligning future empirical studies of facilitation with these features. Synthesis: Closely aligning at least some future empirical work on facilitation with existing mathematical population dynamic theory will further improve understanding of the effects of facilitation on ecological dynamics.},

  abstract = {Although the importance of spatial scale in determining species status (abundance and distribution) is widely recognized, most ecological investigations have been conducted at local scales. Our goal was to investigate the importance of spatial scale in assessing the status of the green frog (Rana clamitans melanota) in the center of its range in eastern North America. Using repeated surveys at 160 ponds from 1992 to 1994, we investigated patterns of occupancy, abundance, and turnover at local, sub-regional, regional, and geographic scales to determine the status of the green frog in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Patterns of pond occupancy were stable at the geographic scale. Occupancy was stable in two regions and decreased in one. At the sub-regional scale, occupancy was stable in six sub-regions, increased in one, and decreased in two. Patterns of adult abundance were stable at the geographic scale. At the regional scale trends in adult abundance were increasing, decreasing, or stable in each of three regions. At the sub-regional scale abundance was stable in three, increasing in one, decreasing in two, and no trend occurred in three sub-regions. At the local scale abundance was stable at 20\% of ponds, increased at 17.8\%, decreased at 14.4\%, and no trend existed at 47.8\%. Colonization and extinction rates ranged from 0 to 0.20 and 0 to 0.35 ponds/pond occupied/year, respectively, and differed among regions. Local extinctions took place at 25\% of ponds during the study, but no sub-regional or regional scale extinctions occurred. Small populations ({$<$}10 adults/pond) were prone to local extinction. Determination of the status of the green frog is scale dependent. Although green frog populations are dynamic, it is common and stable at the geographic scale, but its status varies among regions or sub-regions. Although processes that negatively affect a species may operate at the local scale, a large-scale perspective is necessary to determine status.},

However, previous empirical studies have reported mixed evidence on the relationships between body size and latitude, raising the question of why some clades of endotherms follow Bergmann's rule, whereas others do not. Here, we synthesized the interspecific relationships between body size and latitude among 16,187 endothermic species (5422 mammals and 10,765 birds) using Bayesian phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models to examine the strength and magnitude of Bergmann's rule. We further assessed the effect of biological and ecological factors (i.e., body mass categories, dietary guild, winter activity, habitat openness, and climate zone) on the variations in the body mass-latitude relationships by adding an interaction term in the models. Our results revealed a generally weak but significant adherence to Bergmann's rule among all endotherms at the global scale. Despite taxonomic variation in the strength of Bergmann's rule, the body mass of species within most animal orders showed an increasing trend toward high latitudes. Generally, large-bodied, temperate species, non-hibernating mammals, and migratory and open-habitat birds tend to conform to Bergmann's rule more than their relatives do. Our results suggest that whether Bergmann's rule applies to a particular taxon is mediated by not only geographic and biological features, but also potential alternate strategies that species might have for thermoregulation. Future studies could explore the potential of integrating comprehensive trait data into phylogenetic comparative analysis to re-assess the classic ecogeographic rules on a global scale.},

  abstract = {The goal of the Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is to strengthen the science-policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services towards conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable development. It does so, in particular, by orchestrating the production, by hundreds of scientists and other knowledge holders from all parts of the world, of scientific reports which assess the state of knowledge on a particular theme (e.g. the pollination assessment), a region (e.g. the on-going four regional assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services in four on-going regional assessments), or at the global level, in response to requests from decision-makers. This Methodological Assessment of Scenarios and Models of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services was initiated in order to provide expert advice on the use of such methods in all work under IPBES to ensure the policy relevance of its deliverables. It is one of the first assessment activities of IPBES because it provides guidance for the use of scenarios and models in the regional, global and thematic assessments, as well as by the other task forces and expert groups of IPBES. Because the assessment focuses on methods, this report is more technical in nature than other thematic, regional and global assessments of IPBES. In particular, the assessment focuses on the following: ~Critical analyses of the state-of-the-art and best practices for using scenarios and models in assessments, policy design and policy implementation relevant to biodiversity and ecosystem services; ~Proposed means for addressing gaps in data, knowledge, methods and tools relating to scenarios and models; ~Recommendations for action by IPBES member States, stakeholders and the scientific community to implement and encourage those best practices in regard to the use of scenarios and models, engage in capacity-building and mobilize indigenous and local knowledge. The Methodological Assessment Report on Scenarios and Models of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services was prepared in accordance with decision IPBES-2/5 on the IPBES work programme. The Multidisciplinary Expert Panel along with the Bureau prepared an initial scoping document for the assessment (IPBES/2/17, annex VI), which served as a basis for the second session of the IPBES Plenary (Antalya, 2013) to approve the undertaking of the assessment. This assessment report has been developed in accordance with the procedures for the preparation of Platform deliverables (annex I to decision IPBES-3/3). Governments and stakeholders nominated experts for the author team. The final author team consisted of two Co-chairs, 15~Coordinating Lead Authors, 51 Lead Authors and 12~Review Editors. In addition, during the development of the assessment report, authors selected an additional 21 Contributing Authors to help strengthen various parts of individual chapters. The assessment report underwent an internal review, followed by one formal external review by experts and by a second external formal review, which also included the draft Summary for Policymakers (SPM), by governments and experts. Revisions were made after each review in close collaboration with Review Editors who ensured that all comments were fully considered. The Scenarios and Models team received approximately 2360 comments from 194 expert reviewers (combined from the First Order Draft review and the Second Order Draft review) from 45 countries. The IPBES Plenary approved the SPM, and accepted the individual chapters of the assessment, at its fourth session in Kuala Lumpur, 22-28 February, 2016.},

  abstract = {Shallow lakes can shift between stable states as a result of anthropogenic or natural drivers. Four common stable states differ in dominant groups of primary producers: submerged, floating, or emergent macrophytes or phytoplankton. Shifts in primary producer dominance affect key supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services supplied by lakes. However, links between states and services are often neglected or unknown in lake management, resulting in conflicts and additional costs. Here, we identify major shallow lake ecosystem services and their links to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), compare service provisioning among the four ecosystem states and discuss potential trade-offs. We identified 39 ecosystem services potentially provided by shallow lakes. Submerged macrophytes facilitate most of the supporting (86\%) and cultural (63\%) services, emergent macrophytes facilitate most regulating services (60\%), and both emergent and floating macrophytes facilitate most provisioning services (63\%). Phytoplankton dominance supports fewer ecosystem services, and contributes most to provisioning services (42\%). The shallow lake ecosystem services we identified could be linked to 10 different SDGs, notably zero hunger (SDG 2), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG13). We highlighted several trade-offs (1) among ecosystem services, (2) within ecosystem services, and (3) between ecosystem services across ecosystems. These trade-offs can have significant ecological and economic consequences that may be prevented by early identification in water quality management. In conclusion, common stable states in shallow lakes provide a different and diverse set of ecosystem services with numerous links to the majority of SDGs. Conserving and restoring ecosystem states should account for potential trade-offs between ecosystem services and preserving the natural value of shallow lakes.},

  abstract = {1 Species coexistence depends on the net effect of interacting species, representing the sum of multiple interaction components that may act simultaneously and vary independently depending on ambient environmental conditions. Consequently, for a comprehensive understanding of the compound nature of species interactions and coexistence, a mechanistic approach that allows a separate evaluation of each interaction component is required. 2 Two sessile filter-feeders, the goose barnacle Capitulum mitella and the mussel Septifer virgatus, coexist on moderately wave-exposed rocky shores in south-western Japan. In the upper intertidal, Capitulum positively influenced Septifer survivorship and growth through amelioration of thermal stress and of physical disturbance. On the other hand, these species are potential competitors as they have similar body sizes and modes of resource utilization.

  abstract = {1 Species coexistence depends on the net effect of interacting species, representing the sum of multiple interaction components that may act simultaneously and vary independently depending on ambient environmental conditions. Consequently, for a comprehensive understanding of the compound nature of species interactions and coexistence, a mechanistic approach that allows a separate evaluation of each interaction component is required. 2 Two sessile filter-feeders, the goose barnacle Capitulum mitella and the mussel Septifer virgatus, coexist on moderately wave-exposed rocky shores in south-western Japan. In the upper intertidal, Capitulum positively influenced Septifer survivorship and growth through amelioration of thermal stress and of physical disturbance. On the other hand, these species are potential competitors as they have similar body sizes and modes of resource utilization. These opposite processes, facilitation and competition, are based on abiotic characteristics and biotic functions of the two species, respectively. 3 In order to quantify the bidirectional abiotic, biotic and net effects, a series of experimental manipulations was conducted involving the use of living neighbours with both abiotic and biotic effects, and artificial mimics to simulate abiotic effects without biotic effects. 4 Capitulum had strong positive abiotic effects on the mussel survivorship in most experimental periods, while the biotic effect was negligible or weakly negative, suggesting that the net effect of Capitulum on mussel survival was largely attributable to the abiotic effect.

We address this question by exploring several recent case studies and synthetic analyses of insects. First, different life stages may inhabit different microhabitats, and may differ in their thermal sensitivities and other traits that are important for responses to climate. For example, the life stages of Manduca experience different patterns of thermal and hydric variability, and differ in tolerance to high temperatures. Second, life stages may differ in their mechanisms for adaptation to local climatic conditions. For example, in Colias, larvae in different geographic populations and species adapt to local climate via differences in optimal and maximal temperatures for feeding and growth, whereas adults adapt via differences in melanin of the wings and in other morphological traits. Third, we extend a recent analysis of the temperature-dependence of insect population growth to demonstrate how changes in temperature can differently impact juvenile survival and adult reproduction. In both temperate and tropical regions, high rates of adult reproduction in a given environment may not be realized if occasional, high temperatures prevent survival to maturity. This suggests that considering the differing responses of multiple life stages is essential to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change.},

Yet they are disproportionately threatened compared to terrestrial and marine systems and remain underrepresented in the scenarios and models used for global environmental assessments. The Nature Futures Framework (NFF) has recently been proposed to advance the contribution of scenarios and models for environmental assessments. This framework places the diverse relationships between people and nature at its core, identifying three value perspectives as points of departure: Nature for Nature, Nature for Society, and Nature as Culture. We explore how the NFF may be implemented for improved assessment of freshwater ecosystems. First, we outline how the NFF and its main value perspectives can be translated to freshwater systems and explore what desirable freshwater futures would look like from each of the above perspectives. Second, we review scenario strategies and current models to examine how freshwater modelling can be linked to the NFF in terms of its aims and outcomes. In doing so, we also identify which aspects of the NFF framework are not yet captured in current freshwater models and suggest possible ways to bridge them. Our analysis provides future directions for a more holistic freshwater model and scenario development and demonstrates how society can benefit from freshwater modelling efforts that are integrated with the value-perspectives of the NFF.},

Habitat-formers can also extend the realized niche of other habitat-forming species by facilitating their recruitment into novel environments across heterogeneous landscapes. However, further understanding of whether secondary habitat-formers in these novel environments differ in their structure or support different communities from those settled in their natal habitat is required. Here, we investigated whether abiotic and biotic conditions in a novel connected habitat influence biodiversity within a secondary habitat-former facilitated outside its natal habitat. We contrasted the morphology of the habitat-forming alga, Sirophysalis trinodis, and its associated fish and epifaunal community occurring on rocky reef (natal habitat) and on nearby a biogenic hard substrate, live clam shells (novel habitat) in soft sediments. The algae on clams had a different morphology to those on the rocky shore and supported increased abundance of some epifaunal species. A reciprocal transplant experiment of S. trinodis individuals among habitats found that differences in the abundance of epifauna were explained by the increased abundance and consumption rates of predatory fish on the reef habitat compared to soft-sediment habitats, and not by differences in algal morphology between habitats. We demonstrate that facilitation promotes a secondary habitat-former into a novel habitat, which then enhances the abundance of associated epifauna by providing a predation refuge. This study contributes to a small but growing body of research demonstrating landscape-scale effects of facilitation cascades, and that basal habitat-formers can extend the realized niche of secondary habitat-formers and their associated communities.},

What is the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors (i.e. direct environmental induction) in determining latitudinal patterns of body size variation in common frogs? Methods: We tested for a positive association between mean body size and latitude in common frogs (Rana temporaria) across a 1600 km long latitudinal gradient in Scandinavia both for wild-collected adults and laboratory-reared metamorphs. Results: In adults, the mean body size increased from south to mid-latitudes, and declined thereafter. This occurred despite the fact that the mean age of adult frogs increased with increasing latitude, and age and body size were positively correlated. The latitudinal pattern of body size variation in metamorphs reared in a common garden experiment was similar to that observed among wild-caught adults. Conclusions: The results suggest that the concave pattern of body size variation across the latitudinal cline may be at least partly genetically determined, and that although there is considerable geographic variation in mean body size of R. temporaria, this variation does not conform with Bergmann's rule.},

Masses of gastroliths consistent with the presence of a gastric mill are preserved in many Early Cretaceous Jehol birds mostly belonging to the Ornithuromorpha. Gastroliths are also present in basal birds Sapeornis and Jeholornis in which herbivory is supported by direct evidence these taxa consumed seeds in the form of crop or stomach contents. Although gastroliths have been correlated with herbivory in non-avian dinosaurs, the presence of gastroliths and bone together in Ambopteryx calls this association in to question. Despite being known from greater numbers of specimens than other avian lineages, no unequivocal direct or indirect evidence of diet has been recovered from Jehol deposits for the Enantiornithes. A referred specimen of Bohaiornis guoi IVPP V17963 was described as preserving a small number of gastroliths interpreted as rangle, gastroliths whose function is cleaning the stomach in extant raptorial birds. However, based on comparison with gastroliths in other Jehol birds, it has alternatively been suggested that the identified structures are not ingested stones at all but some unusual mineral precipitate. Considering the limited evidence regarding diet in Enantiornithes and the importance of accurately identifying the traces in Bohaiornis in order to understand the enantiornithine digestive system, we extracted two samples of these purported gastroliths and explored these traces using computerized laminography scanning, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, ground sections, and body size to gastral mass regressions. Similar analyses were conducted on gastroliths extracted from undisputed gastral masses of two Jehol ornithuromorphs and the non-avian pennaraptoran Caudipteryx. The combined results contradict the hypothesis that these traces are gastroliths and supports the interpretation they are mineral precipitate, most likely authigenic quartz (chalcedony). Although authigenesis is commonly responsible for the preservation of soft tissues, it is unclear if these traces record part of the tissues of this Bohaiornis. This study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in understanding unusual traces in the fossil record and reveal a previously unidentified taphonomic phenomenon in fossils from Jehol deposits.},

  abstract = {Rana chensinensis (David, 1875) is a temperate anuran endemic to northern China. We examined differences in demographic traits of the populations from three elevations (1400, 1700, and 2000~m) along a montane river in 2002. We found that frogs from higher elevations had delayed maturity, a larger size at maturity, and slower growth rates compared with frogs at lower elevations. This life-history model is similar to observations of other amphibians living in montane areas. However, discordance with the expected model occurred between neighboring populations and the variation was sex-specific. Mid-elevation adult males were significantly older and larger than their low-elevation congeners, but they were statistically similar in age and size to frogs from high elevations; females from mid elevations were not statistically different in age and size from females from our low-elevation site, but they were significantly younger and smaller than high-elevation females. These variations may be related to sexual differences in life-history strategies, which might not covary systematically when elevational gradients are set at a finer scale. At each elevation, the sex ratio was skewed towards females; females also matured later, lived longer, and were larger. Age was a major factor related to size, but other factors played a role in shaping size differences both between populations and between sexes.},

We examined differences in demographic traits of the populations from three elevations (1400, 1700, and 2000 m) along a montane river in 2002. We found that frogs from higher elevations had delayed maturity, a larger size at maturity, and slower growth rates compared with frogs at lower elevations. This life-history model is similar to observations of other amphibians living in montane areas. However, discordance with the expected model occurred between neighboring populations and the variation was sex-specific. Mid-elevation adult males were significantly older and larger than their low-elevation congeners, but they were statistically similar in age and size to frogs from high elevations; females from mid elevations were not statistically different in age and size from females from our low-elevation site, but they were significantly younger and smaller than high-elevation females. These variations may be related to sexual differences in life-history strategies, which might not covary systematically when elevational gradients are set at a finer scale. At each elevation, the sex ratio was skewed towards females; females also matured later, lived longer, and were larger. Age was a major factor related to size, but other factors played a role in shaping size differences both between populations and between sexes.},

  abstract = {N-mixture models were born in 2004 of the necessity to model animal population size from point counts with imperfect detection of individuals, where capture-recapture methods are infeasible. Initially developed for applications where population size was assumed constant, N-mixture models were extended in 2011 to include population dynamics, allowing application to populations whose size fluctuates during the study. A further extension in 2014 accommodates populations with multiple ``states'' such as age class or sex. More recent extensions model spatial movement of animals among habitat patches or the spatial spread of infectious disease in a human population. The core idea underlying this class of models is a hierarchical structure, where the observation model is defined conditional on the model for true abundance. This hierarchy allows researchers to incorporate information about observation and abundance processes, while permitting distinct inferences about elements affecting detection and those affecting abundance. Another benefit of the hierarchical approach is the ability to accommodate many existing sampling protocols such as removal sampling and distance sampling. One drawback to N-mixture models is that since they estimate both abundance and detection from replicated but unmarked counts, model parameters may not be clearly identifiable. A second drawback is that when observed counts are large, calculating the N-mixture likelihood is computationally infeasible. This difficulty motivated an approximate likelihood based on the normal approximation to the binomial. The normal approximation provides a diagnostic of parameter estimability based on the closed-form expression of the Fisher information matrix for a multivariate normal likelihood.

However, no study has yet explored to what extent the association between body size variation and environmental gradients across broad spatial scales is influenced by the biogeographical distribution of different phylogenetic lineages. In this study, we discriminate the influences of environmental variables and phylogenetic community composition on body size variation in South American sigmodontine rodents. Location South America. Methods We computed the mean body mass of sigmodontine species co-occurring in 1 {\texttimes} 1{$^\circ$} cells across South America. For each cell we recorded mean values for three environmental variables. We characterized the phylogenetic composition of sigmodontine assemblages within each cell using phylogenetic fuzzy-weighting and principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure (PCPS). We then partitioned out the influence of environmental factors and the phylogenetic community composition on mean body size. Results Mean body size variation was mostly explained by shared influence of phylogenetic community composition (PCPS) and environmental factors (68\%), while exclusive influence of PCPS was low (19\%), and of environment was even lower (0.47\%). Increases in body size were related to increases in annual mean temperature, and the influence of environment on body size was mediated by the distribution of sigmodontine lineages across South America. Main conclusions Environment alone was not sufficient to explain body size variation in sigmodontine assemblages. Rather, environmental gradients interacted with historical processes to determine body size variation in the Neotropical assemblages.

Overall, frogs from higher elevations tended to be larger in body size, partially because despite shorter growing seasons, they lived longer as a result of delayed maturity. However, discordance with the expected cline was detected between neighboring populations and the variation was sex specific. Adult females became significantly older and larger as elevation varied from 567 m to 1470 m, but the two traits no longer increased with an elevational shift from 1470 m to 1700 m. Adult males at 1470 m were similar in age and size to animals at 567 m but significantly younger and smaller than those at 1700 m. This suggested that sexes could be exposed to different pressures along elevation gradients with females being stronger than males in life history responses to the elevation-induced environmental change. We also showed that factors other than age also contributed to size differences both among populations and between the sexes.},

We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change.},

This dependency accounts for a change in mass with respect to geography, including latitude (Bergmann's rule), a desert existence, and life on oceanic islands (the island rule), as well as in a seasonal anticipation of winter (Dehnel's phenomenon) and a tendency for some lineages to increase in mass through time (Cope's rule). Such a generalized pattern could be called the "resource rule," reflecting the controlling effect of resource availability on body mass and energy expenditure. The correlation of mammalian size with geography and time reflects the impact of temperature, rainfall, and season on primary production, as well as the necessity in the case of some species to share resources with competitors. The inability of the constituent "rules" to account for all size trends often results from unique patterns of resource availability.},

  abstract = {The tendency of mammals to increase or decrease body size with respect to geography or time depends on the abundance, availability, and size of resources. This dependency accounts for a change in mass with respect to geography, including latitude (Bergmann's rule), a desert existence, and life on oceanic islands (the island rule), as well as in a seasonal anticipation of winter (Dehnel's phenomenon) and a tendency for some lineages to increase in mass through time (Cope's rule). Such a generalized pattern could be called the "resource rule," reflecting the controlling effect of resource availability on body mass and energy expenditure. The correlation of mammalian size with geography and time reflects the impact of temperature, rainfall, and season on primary production, as well as the necessity in the case of some species to share resources with competitors. The inability of the constituent "rules" to account for all size trends often results from unique patterns of resource availability.},

Standard practice seems to be an examination of mean body sizes within higher taxa on gridded maps, with little regard to species richness or phylogeny. However, because the frequency distribution of body sizes is typically highly skewed, average size within grid cells may differ significantly between species-rich and species-poor cells even when the median and modal sizes remain constant. Species richness influences body size patterns because species are not added to communities at random in relation to their size: areas of low diversity are characterized by a higher range of body sizes than is expected by chance. Finally, a consideration of phylogenetic structure within taxa is necessary to elucidate whether patterns in the geography of size result from turnover between or within intermediate taxonomic levels.

The literature neglects; however, the role of the communities which benefit from the presence of the nurse as contributors to soil ecosystem functions. We hypothesized that the nurse and its beneficiaries synergistically enhance essential ecosystem functions mediated by soil microbiota. To track how plant--plant facilitation impacts plant--soil feedbacks, we selected three nurse species in semi-arid mine tailings and defined three microsites (open space, nurse canopy and nurse + facilitated canopy). In each microsite, we quantified 18 abiotic and biotic variables associated with four functions: reduction in climatic stress, reduction in edaphic stress, soil fertility and soil microbial productivity (decomposition and nutrient cycling). Litter biomass increased from open spaces to the microsite beneath the nurses, and further beneath the nurses and their beneficiaries. Litter biomass was a good predictor of both the reduction in climatic stress and increase in edaphic stress (likely owing to metal bioaccumulation). We attributed increments in soil organics and heterotrophic respiration beneath the nurses and their beneficiaries, compared to nurses alone, to biomass effects through increased litter deposition. Variation in fertility and microbial productivity among microsites shaped by the nurses and their facilitated communities was attributed to both diversity and biomass effects. In particular, fertility was promoted beneath phenotypically diverse facilitated communities, as inferred from ten above- and below-ground traits. However, microbial productivity increased at low levels of root biomass likely due to reduced plant--microbe competition for nutrients. Synthesis. Our results show that facilitated plant communities sheltered by nurse species relieve local abiotic stress and promote plant--microbe interactions, both through biomass and biodiversity effects. These observations shift the conception of facilitated species from simple beneficiaries of the nurse's effects to co-drivers of essential ecosystem functions.},

  abstract = {There has been rapid development in tools for multivariate analysis based on fully specified statistical models or `joint models'. One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in `fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

  abstract = {There has been rapid development in tools for multivariate analysis based on fully specified statistical models or `joint models'. One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in `fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

Multiple regression analysis (both global and stepwise) are then used to test the resulting principal components against various biotic and abiotic factors.

Our results are consistent with the water availability hypothesis which, coupled with previous findings, suggests that the major determinant of interspecific body size variation in anurans switches from energy to water towards the equator. We propose that anuran body size gradients reflect effects of reduced surface to volume ratios in larger species to control both heat and water balance.}

To illustrate potential hazards of improper use of PVA we reanalyzed data from a recent study on viability of wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park (APP), Ontario, Canada. The original PVA predicted extirpation of wolves from APP and prompted both a ban on wolf harvesting in a 10--16 km buffer zone surrounding the 7571 km2 park and an intensive research program to evaluate efficacy of the ban. Our reanalysis showed that limited and imprecise wolf population density and demographic rate estimates, as well as flawed population assessment and reconstruction methods, led to overly pessimistic evaluation of wolf population status in APP. In fact, our analyses suggest that wolves in APP are unlikely to decline significantly over the next 20 years. Further, contrary to earlier conclusions we suggest that rapid wolf population recovery following protection from human exploitation would be likely and readily detectable. These findings highlight the need for adequate data, appropriate methodology, and proper analytical context when conducting PVA. Because the original PVA prompted substantial redirection of staff and financial resources from other significant conservation initiatives, we conclude that improper PVA may undermine execution of effective wildlife management and ultimately provide a disservice to conservation biology.},

  abstract = {Current rates of climate change are exceeding the capacity of many plant species to track climate, thus leading communities to be in disequilibrium with climatic conditions. Plant canopies can contribute to this disequilibrium by buffering macro-climatic conditions and sheltering poorly adapted species to the oncoming climate, particularly in their recruitment stages. Here we analyse differences in climatic disequilibrium between understorey and open ground woody plant recruits in 28 localities, covering more than 100,000 m2, across an elevation range embedding temperature and aridity gradients in the southern Iberian Peninsula. This study demonstrates higher climatic disequilibrium under canopies compared with open ground, supporting that plant canopies would affect future community climatic lags by allowing the recruitment of less arid-adapted species in warm and dry conditions, but also it endorse that canopies could favour warm-adapted species in extremely cold environments as mountain tops, thus pre-adapting communities living in these habitats to climate change.},

  abstract = {Current rates of climate change are exceeding the capacity of many plant species to track climate, thus leading communities to be in disequilibrium with climatic conditions. Plant canopies can contribute to this disequilibrium by buffering macro-climatic conditions and sheltering poorly adapted species to the oncoming climate, particularly in their recruitment stages. Here we analyse differences in climatic disequilibrium between understorey and open ground woody plant recruits in 28 localities, covering more than 100,000 m2, across an elevation range embedding temperature and aridity gradients in the southern Iberian Peninsula. This study demonstrates higher climatic disequilibrium under canopies compared with open ground, supporting that plant canopies would affect future community climatic lags by allowing the recruitment of less arid-adapted species in warm and dry conditions, but also it endorse that canopies could favour warm-adapted species in extremely cold environments as mountain tops, thus pre-adapting communities living in these habitats to climate change.},

While this topic is popular, most attempts to analyse and predict multiple traits in space and time ignore the inherent correlations between these traits. In doing so, the predicted traits in unobserved environments are likely to be flawed (i.e. unrealistic trait combinations). Here, we propose a framework that addresses this methodological question in functional biogeography. Innovation Our framework relies on joint trait distribution models to quantify how combinations of mean trait values at the community level co-vary as a function of environmental conditions. Making use of joint probabilities and the constraints imposed by trait correlations, our framework not only predicts the most suitable combination of traits in a given environment but also the envelope of possible alternatives. This innovation allows visualizing how the correlation structure between traits imposes a strong constraint (or not) on the expected combination of traits in a given environment. The stronger trait correlations, the smaller the envelope of likely alternative states. We provide an R package implementing our framework. Main Conclusions Applied to plant communities in the French Alps, our framework quantifies the variation of trait combinations at the community-level along environmental gradients that, otherwise, could not be identified. Strong correlations in community mean leaf traits led to a low diversity of alternative combinations of community means, which can only vary along the acquisition-conservation spectrum. Instead, height varied partly independently of leaf traits, leading to a higher diversity in the combinations of mean community traits.

  abstract = {Classical biogeographical observations suggest that ecosystems are strongly shaped by climatic constraints in terms of their structure and function. On the other hand, vegetation function feeds back on the climate system via biosphere--atmosphere exchange of matter and energy. Ecosystem-level observations of this exchange reveal very large functional biogeographical variation of climate-relevant ecosystem functional properties related to carbon and water cycles. This variation is explained insufficiently by climate control and a classical plant functional type classification approach. For example, correlations between seasonal carbon-use efficiency and climate or environmental variables remain below 0.6, leaving almost 70\% of variance unexplained. We suggest that a substantial part of this unexplained variation of ecosystem functional properties is related to variations in plant and microbial traits. Therefore, to progress with global functional biogeography, we should seek to understand the link between organismic traits and flux-derived ecosystem properties at ecosystem observation sites and the spatial variation of vegetation traits given geoecological covariates. This understanding can be fostered by synergistic use of both data-driven and theory-driven ecological as well as biophysical approaches.},

  abstract = {1. Recent advances in occupancy estimation that adjust for imperfect detection have provided substantial improvements over traditional approaches and are receiving considerable use in applied ecology. To estimate and adjust for detectability, occupancy modelling requires multiple surveys at a site and requires the assumption of `closure' between surveys, i.e. no changes in occupancy between surveys. Violations of this assumption could bias parameter estimates; however, little work has assessed model sensitivity to violations of this assumption or how commonly such violations occur in nature. 2.

  abstract = {1. Recent advances in occupancy estimation that adjust for imperfect detection have provided substantial improvements over traditional approaches and are receiving considerable use in applied ecology. To estimate and adjust for detectability, occupancy modelling requires multiple surveys at a site and requires the assumption of `closure' between surveys, i.e. no changes in occupancy between surveys. Violations of this assumption could bias parameter estimates; however, little work has assessed model sensitivity to violations of this assumption or how commonly such violations occur in nature. 2. We apply a modelling procedure that can test for closure to two avian point-count data sets in Montana and New Hampshire, USA, that exemplify time-scales at which closure is often assumed.

While positive species interactions (i.e., facilitation) have historically been underemphasized in ecological research, they are increasingly recognized as playing important roles in the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. Dominant habitat-forming species (foundation species) buffer environmental conditions and can therefore facilitate myriad associated species. Theory predicts that facilitation will be the dominant community-structuring force under harsh environmental conditions, where organisms depend on shelter for survival and predation is diminished. Wind-swept, arid Patagonian rocky shores are one of the most desiccating intertidal rocky shores ever studied, providing an opportunity to test this theory and elucidate the context-dependency of facilitation. Methodology/Principal Findings Surveys across 2100 km of southern Argentinean coastline and experimental manipulations both supported theoretical predictions, with 43 out of 46 species in the animal assemblage obligated to living within the matrices of mussels for protection from potentially lethal desiccation stress and predators having no detectable impact on diversity. Conclusions/Significance These results provide the first experimental support of long-standing theoretical predictions and reveal that in extreme climates, maintenance of whole-community diversity can be maintained by positive interactions that ameliorate physical stress. These findings have important conservation implications and emphasize that preserving foundation species should be a priority in remediating the biodiversity consequences of global climate change.},

Wind-swept, arid Patagonian rocky shores are one of the most desiccating intertidal rocky shores ever studied, providing an opportunity to test this theory and elucidate the context-dependency of facilitation. Methodology/Principal Findings Surveys across 2100 km of southern Argentinean coastline and experimental manipulations both supported theoretical predictions, with 43 out of 46 species in the animal assemblage obligated to living within the matrices of mussels for protection from potentially lethal desiccation stress and predators having no detectable impact on diversity. Conclusions/Significance These results provide the first experimental support of long-standing theoretical predictions and reveal that in extreme climates, maintenance of whole-community diversity can be maintained by positive interactions that ameliorate physical stress. These findings have important conservation implications and emphasize that preserving foundation species should be a priority in remediating the biodiversity consequences of global climate change.},

Ninety sample plots of 1m2 size were located in the study area and were divided into 25 subplots in which presence and abundance of plant species was recorded. The community diversity was expressed as species richness, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness. Correlation between the cushion species and the composition of the colonists was measured with the CCA ordination analysis, correlation between the cushion cover and community diversity was measured by means of correlation analysis. Randomized species--area curves were used to compare richness of plant communities with and without the cushions. A total of 32 species were found including five cushion plants. Most species preferred to grow on the cushion surface whereas only a few species were able to colonize open ground. Species richness and Simpson's index were significantly correlated to the cushion area but no correlation was found for evenness. The cushions were usually composed of more than one species which hampered the examination of the cushion--colonist specific relationships. Nevertheless, cushions of Azorella and Arenaria seemed to provide more favorable habitat for colonization than the other cushion species. Comparison with an earlier study made on Iliniza indicates that the presence of the cushions significantly increases the richness of the plant community.},

The growing body of modelling, descriptive and experimental studies on facilitation covers a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic systems throughout the globe. However, the lack of a general body of theory linking facilitation among different types of organisms and biomes and their responses to environmental changes prevents further advances in our knowledge regarding the evolutionary and ecological implications of facilitation in plant communities. Moreover, insights gathered from alternative lines of inquiry may substantially improve our understanding of facilitation, but these have been largely neglected thus far. Despite over 15 years of research and debate on this topic, there is no consensus on the degree to which plant--plant interactions change predictably along environmental gradients (i.e. the stress-gradient hypothesis), and this hinders our ability to predict how plant--plant interactions may affect the response of plant communities to ongoing global environmental change. The existing controversies regarding the response of plant--plant interactions across environmental gradients can be reconciled when clearly considering and determining the species-specificity of the response, the functional or individual stress type, and the scale of interest (pairwise interactions or community-level response). Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to do this, supported by multiple lines of empirical evidence. We also discuss current gaps in our knowledge regarding how plant--plant interactions change along environmental gradients. These include the existence of thresholds in the amount of species-specific stress that a benefactor can alleviate, the linearity or non-linearity of the response of pairwise interactions across distance from the ecological optimum of the beneficiary, and the need to explore further how frequent interactions among multiple species are and how they change across different environments. We review the latest advances in these topics and provide new approaches to fill current gaps in our knowledge. We also apply our theoretical framework to advance our knowledge on the evolutionary aspects of plant facilitation, and the relative importance of facilitation, in comparison with other ecological processes, for maintaining ecosystem structure, functioning and dynamics. We build links between these topics and related fields, such as ecological restoration, woody encroachment, invasion ecology, ecological modelling and biodiversity--ecosystem-functioning relationships. By identifying commonalities and insights from alternative lines of research, we further advance our understanding of facilitation and provide testable hypotheses regarding the role of (positive) biotic interactions in the maintenance of biodiversity and the response of ecological communities to ongoing environmental changes.},

While these shifts allow organisms to track their thermal niche, these three thermal axes also covary with non-climatic abiotic factors that could pose challenges to range-shifting plants and animals. Such novel abiotic conditions also present an unappreciated pitfall for researchers -- from both empirical and predictive viewpoints -- who study the redistribution of species under global climate change. Climate, particularly temperature, is often assumed to be the primary abiotic factor in limiting species distributions, and decades of thermal biology research have made the correlative and mechanistic understanding of temperature the most accessible and commonly used response to any abiotic factor. Receiving far less attention, however, is that global gradients in oxygen, light, pressure, pH and water availability also covary with latitude, elevation, and/or ocean depth, and species show strong physiological and behavioral adaptations to these abiotic variables within their historic ranges. Here, we discuss how non-climatic abiotic factors may disrupt climate-driven range shifts, as well as the variety of adaptations species use to overcome abiotic conditions, emphasizing which taxa may be most limited in this capacity. We highlight the need for scientists to extend their research to incorporate non-climatic, abiotic factors to create a more ecologically relevant understanding of how plants and animals interact with the environment, particularly in the face of global climate change.

First we determined predator effects on prey habitat use in aquaria with and without Dreissena-shell beds (i.e., ceramic tiles with and without shells attached to them, respectively) by comparing snail distribution in the absence of fish and in the presence of chemical cues produced from redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus) preying on snails. Effectiveness of shell beds and other habitats as refuges from actual predation were then evaluated by introducing fish to aquaria that previously received chemical cues, and recording numbers of snails remaining in various habitats 24 h later. Shells and fish had strong independent and interactive effects on snail habitat use. A greater \% of snails inhabited tiles when shells were present than when they were absent, and this occurred regardless of the absence or perceived presence of fish. However, fish cues caused snails to increase use of shell beds. In an additional experiment, we found that snails under predation risk also altered their microdistribution within shell beds by abandoning exposed shell surfaces in favor of interstices between shells where they were less vulnerable to fish. The combination of protective shell habitat and antipredator behavior caused snail survivorship to be 8-fold greater in the treatment with shells and fish than in the same predator treatment without shells. Our results suggest that avoidance of predators through use of zebra mussel beds is an important mechanism for the positive Dreissena effects on co-occurring benthic invertebrates that have been observed in field studies.},

  abstract = {Occupancy models are a vital tool for ecologists studying the patterns and drivers of species occurrence, but their use often involves selecting among models with different sets of occupancy and detection covariates. The information-theoretic approach, which employs information criteria such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is arguably the most popular approach for model selection in ecology and is often used for selecting occupancy models. However, the information-theoretic approach risks selecting models that produce inaccurate parameter estimates due to a phenomenon called collider bias, a type of confounding that can arise when adding explanatory variables to a model. Using simulations, we investigated the consequences of collider bias (using an illustrative example called M-bias) in the occupancy and detection processes of an occupancy model, and explored the implications for model selection using AIC and a common alternative, the Schwarz criterion (or Bayesian information criterion, BIC). We found that when M-bias was present in the occupancy process, AIC and BIC selected models that inaccurately estimated the effect of the focal occupancy covariate, while simultaneously producing more accurate predictions of the site-level occupancy probability than other models in the candidate set. In contrast, M-bias in the detection process did not impact the focal estimate; all models made accurate inferences, while the site-level predictions of the AIC/BIC-best model were slightly more accurate. Our results show that information criteria can be used to select occupancy covariates if the sole purpose of the model is prediction, but must be treated with more caution if the purpose is to understand how environmental variables affect occupancy. By contrast, detection covariates can usually be selected using information criteria regardless of the model's purpose. These findings illustrate the importance of distinguishing between the tasks of parameter inference and prediction in ecological modeling. Furthermore, our results underline concerns about the use of information criteria to compare different biological hypotheses in observational studies.},

Here, we review progress in conservation of freshwater biodiversity, with a focus on the period since 1986, and outline key challenges for the future. Driven by rising conservation concerns, freshwater ecologists have conducted a great deal of research over the past 25 y on the status, trends, autecology, and propagation of imperiled species, threats to these species, the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, metapopulation dynamics, biodiversity hotspots, reserve design, habitat restoration, communication with stakeholders, and weaknesses of protective legislation. Nevertheless, existing efforts might be insufficient to stem the ongoing and coming multitude of freshwater extinctions. We briefly discuss 4 important challenges for freshwater conservation. First, climate change will imperil both freshwater species and human uses of fresh water, driving engineering responses that will further threaten the freshwater biota. We need to anticipate both ecological and human responses to climate change, and to encourage rational and deliberate planning of engineering responses to climate change before disasters strike. Second, because freshwater extinctions are already well underway, freshwater conservationists must be prepared to act now to prevent further losses, even if our knowledge is incomplete, and engage more effectively with other stakeholders. Third, we need to bridge the gap between freshwater ecology and conservation biology. Fourth, we suggest that scientific societies and scholarly journals concerned with limnology or freshwater sciences need to improve their historically poor record in publishing important papers and influencing practice in conservation ecology.

  abstract = {{$\bullet$} Premise of the study: Near-future climate changes are likely to elicit major vegetation changes. Disequilibrium dynamics, which occur when vegetation comes out of equilibrium with climate, are potentially a key facet of these. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making accurate predictions, informing conservation planning, and understanding likely changes in ecosystem function on time scales relevant to society. However, many predictive studies have instead focused on equilibrium end-points with little consideration of the transient trajectories. {$\bullet$} Methods: We review what we should expect in terms of disequilibrium vegetation dynamics over the next 50--200 yr, covering a broad range of research fields including paleoecology, macroecology, landscape ecology, vegetation science, plant ecology, invasion biology, global change biology, and ecosystem ecology. {$\bullet$} Key results: The expected climate changes are likely to induce marked vegetation disequilibrium with climate at both leading and trailing edges, with leading-edge disequilibrium dynamics due to lags in migration at continental to landscape scales, in local population build-up and succession, in local evolutionary responses, and in ecosystem development, and trailing-edge disequilibrium dynamics involving delayed local extinctions and slow losses of ecosystem structural components.

  abstract = {{$\bullet$} Premise of the study: Near-future climate changes are likely to elicit major vegetation changes. Disequilibrium dynamics, which occur when vegetation comes out of equilibrium with climate, are potentially a key facet of these. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making accurate predictions, informing conservation planning, and understanding likely changes in ecosystem function on time scales relevant to society. However, many predictive studies have instead focused on equilibrium end-points with little consideration of the transient trajectories. {$\bullet$} Methods: We review what we should expect in terms of disequilibrium vegetation dynamics over the next 50--200 yr, covering a broad range of research fields including paleoecology, macroecology, landscape ecology, vegetation science, plant ecology, invasion biology, global change biology, and ecosystem ecology. {$\bullet$} Key results: The expected climate changes are likely to induce marked vegetation disequilibrium with climate at both leading and trailing edges, with leading-edge disequilibrium dynamics due to lags in migration at continental to landscape scales, in local population build-up and succession, in local evolutionary responses, and in ecosystem development, and trailing-edge disequilibrium dynamics involving delayed local extinctions and slow losses of ecosystem structural components. Interactions with habitat loss and invasive pests and pathogens are likely to further contribute to disequilibrium dynamics. Predictive modeling and climate-change experiments are increasingly representing disequilibrium dynamics, but with scope for improvement. {$\bullet$} Conclusions: The likely pervasiveness and complexity of vegetation disequilibrium is a major challenge for forecasting ecological dynamics and, combined with the high ecological importance of vegetation, also constitutes a major challenge for future nature conservation.},

Most studies on non-native species in marshes describe terrestrial angiosperms. We document that a non-native marine macroalga, Gracilaria vermiculophylla, is abundant throughout Virginia's Atlantic coastline. We sampled eight marshes, characterized by low slopes and by the presence of the tube-building polychaete Diopatra cuprea on adjacent mudflats, which have been shown previously to be associated with G. vermiculophylla. G. vermiculophylla was found in 71\% of the sampled quadrats on the border between the mudflat and tall Spartina alterniflora, 51\% within the tall S. alterniflora zone, and 12\% further inland. We also tagged G. vermiculophylla from two habitats: (1) unattached G. vermiculophylla within marshes and (2) G. vermiculophylla `incorporated' onto D. cuprea tubes on the adjacent mudflats. Of the incorporated thalli, 3--9\% ended up in the marsh, demonstrating connectivity between habitats. In addition, 21\% of unattached thalli remained for 2weeks within the marsh, suggesting that entanglement around marsh plants reduces tidal drift. Growth experiments in mesh bags indicate that most of the G. vermiculophylla transferred from the lagoon to the marsh decomposed there, potentially enhancing local nutrient levels. Finally, we document that G. vermiculophylla in marshes had a reduced associated flora and fauna compared to G. vermiculophylla on the adjacent Diopatra mudflats. In conclusion, unattached G. vermiculophylla is abundant along marsh borders in the tall S. alterniflora zone in Virginia, and we hypothesize that this non-native species has significant impacts in terms of marsh habitat complexity, species abundance and diversity, nutrient dynamics, productivity, and trophic interactions.},

Here we conceptualize a specific type of facilitation cascade---the habitat cascade. The habitat cascade is defined as indirect positive effects on focal organisms mediated by successive facilitation in the form of biogenic formation or modification of habitat. Based on a literature review, we demonstrate that habitat cascades are a general phenomenon that enhances species abundance and diversity in forests, salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and seaweed beds. Habitat cascades are characterized by a hierarchy of facilitative interactions in which a basal habitat former (typically a large primary producer, e.g., a tree) creates living space for an intermediate habitat former (e.g., an epiphyte) that in turn creates living space for the focal organisms (e.g., spiders, beetles, and mites). We then present new data on a habitat cascade common to soft-bottom estuaries in which a relatively small invertebrate provides basal habitat for larger intermediate seaweeds that, in turn, generate habitat for focal invertebrates and epiphytes. We propose that indirect positive effects on focal organisms will be strongest when the intermediate habitat former is larger and different in form and function from the basal habitat former. We also discuss how humans create, modify, and destroy habitat cascades via global habitat destruction, climatic change, over-harvesting, pollution, or transfer of invasive species. Finally, we outline future directions for research that will lead to a better understanding of habitat cascades.},

Complementary unweighted analyses on log response ratios revealed that the magnitude of these effects was similar to the global average strength of direct facilitation from primary foundation species and greater than the average strength of trophic cascades, a widely recognized type of indirect facilitation arising through sequential consumption. The finding that secondary FS enhance the abundance and richness of inhabitants has important implications for understanding the mechanisms that regulate biodiversity.

We evaluated changes in statistics used by ecologists by searching nearly 20,000 published articles in ecology from 1990 to 2013. We found that there has been a rise in sophisticated and computationally intensive statistical techniques such as mixed effects models and Bayesian statistics and a decline in reliance on approaches such as ANOVA or t tests. Similarly, ecologists have shifted away from software such as SAS and SPSS to the open source program R. We also searched the published curricula and syllabi of 154 doctoral programs in the United States and found that despite obvious changes in the statistical practices of ecologists, more than one-third of doctoral programs showed no record of required or optional statistics classes. Approximately one-quarter of programs did require a statistics course, but most of those did not cover contemporary statistical philosophy or advanced techniques. Only one-third of doctoral programs surveyed even listed an optional course that teaches some aspect of contemporary statistics. We call for graduate programs to lead the charge in improving training of future ecologists with skills needed to address and understand the ecological challenges facing humanity.},

  abstract = {Global conservation targets to reverse biodiversity declines and halt species extinctions are not being met despite decades of conservation action. However, a lack of measurable change in biodiversity indicators towards these targets is not necessarily a sign that conservation has failed; instead, temporal lags in species' responses to conservation action could be masking our ability to observe progress towards conservation success. Here we present our perspective on the influence of ecological time lags on the assessment of conservation success and review the principles of time lags and their ecological drivers. We illustrate how a number of conceptual species may respond to change in a theoretical landscape and evaluate how these responses might influence our interpretation of conservation success. We then investigate a time lag in a real biodiversity indicator using empirical data and explore alternative approaches to understand the mechanisms that drive time lags. Our proposal for setting and evaluating conservation targets is to use milestones, or interim targets linked to specific ecological mechanisms at key points in time, to assess whether conservation actions are likely to be working. Accounting for ecological time lags in biodiversity targets and indicators will greatly improve the way that we evaluate conservation successes.},

  abstract = {Freshwater macroinvertebrates are a diverse group and play key ecological roles, including accelerating nutrient cycling, filtering water, controlling primary producers, and providing food for predators. Their differences in tolerances and short generation times manifest in rapid community responses to change. Macroinvertebrate community composition is an indicator of water quality. In Europe, efforts to improve water quality following environmental legislation, primarily starting in the 1980s, may have driven a recovery of macroinvertebrate communities. Towards understanding temporal and spatial variation of these organisms, we compiled the TREAM dataset (Time seRies of European freshwAter Macroinvertebrates), consisting of macroinvertebrate community time series from 1,816 river and stream sites (mean length of 19.2 years and 14.9 sampling years) of 22 European countries sampled between 1968 and 2020. In total, the data include {$>$}93 million sampled individuals of 2,648 taxa from 959 genera and 212 families. These data can be used to test questions ranging from identifying drivers of the population dynamics of specific taxa to assessing the success of legislative and management restoration efforts.},

Existing adaptational explanations seek selective advantages in diploidy and in sexual reproduction, but these explanations leave much to be explained--i.e., the existence of asexuality and of haploid organisms. Much of the existing variation in life cycles can be explained by selection on reproductive rates to meet the ecological problems of dispersal, colonization, niche preemption and exploitation, and mate competition.
